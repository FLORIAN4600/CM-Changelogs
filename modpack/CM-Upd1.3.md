// Warning, This is a Preview of the 1.3 update. Features announced here might never make their way to the official modpack latest release \\

# Create Multiplex v1.3 - Minimal/Lite
## Additions:
- Brute Force Render Culling *permisses to cull additionnal chunks that the player cannot see, use for better performances*
- Distant Horizons *permisses having a far better render distance for minor performances costs* ***(usefull for people with potato computer as it implies aving the mod dealing with down from 32 chunks of render distance, while Minecraft render distance is set to 4)***
- JEI Multiblocks *adds a way to preview the Immersive Engineering multiblocks & to see their total costs*

## Removals:
- Lazurite *(Embeddium now comes with its own FRAPI compatibility)*
- Journeymap Teams *(Duplicate with Journeymap Integration)*
- Entity Culling *as it's becoming a duplicate with Brute Force Render Culling, and because it is using on its own 1 Gig of RAM (determined in start menu)*
- Create Encased *Is pure cosmetics, and uses 200-300 Mb of RAM (determined in start menu)*
- Create Track Map *This mod is server-only... It should not be in here*
